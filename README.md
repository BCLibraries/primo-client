# Primo Client

A client for accessing the [Primo Brief Search RESTful API](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/primo/apis/docs/primoSearch/R0VUIC9wcmltby92MS9zZWFyY2g=/) in PHP.

## Installation

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Primo-Client.

```bash
composer require bclibraries/primo-client:^0.1
```

Primo Client is currently a 0.* release, so things might change drastically with any minor release.

## Usage

Create a configuration hash and pass it to `PrimoClient::build()` to 
instantiate a client.

```php
$config = [
    'apikey' => 'l7xx38c6a1a3043974262e81a81fb7475ba9',
    'gateway' => 'https://api-na.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com',
    'vid' => 'my_vid',
    'tab' => 'the_tab',
    'scope' => 'mylib'
];
$primo = \BCLib\PrimoClient\PrimoClient::build($config);
$result = $primo->search('otters');
```
